<ARA_Ability_Possess.description>It leaps onto its target, pierces its nerve center with its tail stinger, and replaces it with its own control signals. If the parasitism is successful, the target's body is completely taken over and it acts as a member of the Arachne swarm; if it cannot penetrate the armor, the parasitism fails, but it is unable to penetrate the captive or inactive body. It is always successful against the powerful.\n\nThe parasite needs to receive the pheromone tag of the Empress species, and continues to live like a shell without emotions or higher-order desires.The target's skills and background are replaced with those of the protozoan species, and when the host dies, the protozoan species escapes from the body.</ARA_Ability_Possess.description>
