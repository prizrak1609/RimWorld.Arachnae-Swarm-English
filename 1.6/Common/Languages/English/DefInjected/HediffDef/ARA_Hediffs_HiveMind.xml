<ARA_HiveMindDrone.comps.1.letterText>A new Arachne insect {0_labelShort} has broken out of its cocoon and emerged! She wanders around waiting for instructions from the Empress species - she can complete the link with the Arachne Empress' information mark skill, or she can wait for the link to be built automatically.</ARA_HiveMindDrone.comps.1.letterText>

<ARA_HiveMindWorker.description>Arachne flocculata is connected to the Arachne ficus in the heart.When the fibril dies, the flocculent also ceases its life activities.</ARA_HiveMindWorker.description>
<ARA_HiveMindBeast.label>arachne beast insect</ARA_HiveMindBeast.label>
<ARA_HiveMindBeast.description>Arachne beasts are more primitive life forms than other members of the Arachne family. Although they have simple heads and well-developed limbs, they do not follow the hive's pyramidal thinking as much. Within their hives, they receive command from any governor and empress species.</ARA_HiveMindBeast.description>

<ARA_HiveStrength_Pluse.description>The repair cells of this Arachnidae family have reached a level that cannot be measured by common sense anymore.No matter how severe the injury, they are almost never destroyed.Furthermore, these powerful cells also provide resistance to damage caused by acid erosion and Arachnid acid.</ARA_HiveStrength_Pluse.description>
<ARA_HiveStrength.label>Insect colony vitality</ARA_HiveStrength.label>
<ARA_HiveStrength.description>The repair cells of this arachnoid family are special and can self-repair wounds at an extremely rapid rate and even regenerate lost organs.These powerful cells also provide resistance to acid erosion and damage from arachnoid acids.</ARA_HiveStrength.description>
<ARA_HiveStrength_Low.label>Insect colony health</ARA_HiveStrength_Low.label>
<ARA_HiveStrength_Low.description>Arachnoid insects have strong wound repair abilities and can quickly recover from various fatal damages. These powerful cells also make them resistant to acid erosion and damage from arachnoid acid.</ARA_HiveStrength_Low.description>

<ARA_TemperatureRegulation.label>cold blooded animal</ARA_TemperatureRegulation.label>
<ARA_TemperatureRegulation.description>The Arachnidae are cold-blooded animals and sensitive to changes in external temperature; agile and deadly in moderate temperatures, and difficult to move in unsuitable temperatures.\n\nThis species can operate at temperatures between 6 and 36°C, and gains an additional awareness bonus when temperatures are around 21°C.</ARA_TemperatureRegulation.description>
