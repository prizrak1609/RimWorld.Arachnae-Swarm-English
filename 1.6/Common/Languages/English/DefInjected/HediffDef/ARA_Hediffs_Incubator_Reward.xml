  <ARA_Incubator_1_Reward_Hediffs.label>dense carapace</ARA_Incubator_1_Reward_Hediffs.label>
  <ARA_Incubator_1_Reward_Hediffs.description>The Arachnidok's carapace is more compact than that of a regular Zerg, giving her carapace extra defense. \n\nDue to good hatching quality, the Arachnidok acquired this advantageous mutation.</ARA_Incubator_1_Reward_Hediffs.description>
  <ARA_Incubator_2_Reward_Hediffs.label>Flame retardant grease under shell</ARA_Incubator_2_Reward_Hediffs.label>
  <ARA_Incubator_2_Reward_Hediffs.description>The arachnid's subcutaneous fat acquires a flame-retardant effect due to favorable mutations. When a Zerg is burned by flames, the layer of flame-retardant fat bursts to extinguish the fire. \n\nDue to good hatching quality, the Arachnidok acquired this advantageous mutation.</ARA_Incubator_2_Reward_Hediffs.description>
  <ARA_Incubator_3_Reward_Hediffs.label>action hormone</ARA_Incubator_3_Reward_Hediffs.label>
  <ARA_Incubator_3_Reward_Hediffs.description>The Arachneid's gland is very abnormal. It will continuously secrete hormones to make it in an excited state, and it can be transmitted to the armed organs connected to it. \n\nDue to good hatching quality, the Arachnidok acquired this advantageous mutation.</ARA_Incubator_3_Reward_Hediffs.description>
  <ARA_Incubator_4_Reward_Hediffs.label>high static vision</ARA_Incubator_4_Reward_Hediffs.label>
  <ARA_Incubator_4_Reward_Hediffs.description>The advantageous mutation of this Arachneid has given it advanced static vision that is different from other Zerg species, which makes up for its shortcomings in vision and makes it easier to shoot. \n\nDue to good hatching quality, the Arachnidok acquired this advantageous mutation.</ARA_Incubator_4_Reward_Hediffs.description>
  <ARA_Incubator_5_Reward_Hediffs.label>strong muscles</ARA_Incubator_5_Reward_Hediffs.label>
  <ARA_Incubator_5_Reward_Hediffs.description>The Arachnedo was incredibly strong—it was over-nourished. \n\nDue to good hatching quality, the Arachnidok acquired this advantageous mutation.</ARA_Incubator_5_Reward_Hediffs.description>
  <ARA_Incubator_6_Reward_Hediffs.label>Central strengthening</ARA_Incubator_6_Reward_Hediffs.label>
  <ARA_Incubator_6_Reward_Hediffs.description>The Arachnidok's neurological reactions far exceed those of other Zerg species, and thanks to its stronger reflexes, its movements become agile and deadly. \n\nDue to good hatching quality, the Arachnidok acquired this advantageous mutation.</ARA_Incubator_6_Reward_Hediffs.description>
  <ARA_Incubator_7_Reward_Hediffs.label>plastic memory</ARA_Incubator_7_Reward_Hediffs.label>
  <ARA_Incubator_7_Reward_Hediffs.description>The Arachneid's memory structure is more complex and can quickly absorb new knowledge and experience. \n\nDue to good hatching quality, the Arachnidok acquired this advantageous mutation.</ARA_Incubator_7_Reward_Hediffs.description>
  <ARA_Incubator_8_Reward_Hediffs.label>coagulation factors</ARA_Incubator_8_Reward_Hediffs.label>
  <ARA_Incubator_8_Reward_Hediffs.description>The coagulation system of this Arachneid is more efficient, and a variety of special coagulation factors that are not found in other Arachnids greatly slow down its bleeding rate. \n\nDue to good hatching quality, the Arachnidok acquired this advantageous mutation.</ARA_Incubator_8_Reward_Hediffs.description>
