  <ARA_HiveCorvette_Building.description>The Celestial Witch Beast Insects are ground-attack aircraft in the Arachne Swarm fleet. Their long tentacles and powerful psionic levitation abilities allow them to traverse the battlefield at high speed under the command of the Pilots, striking unsuspecting enemy swarms or aiding the Swarm's attack. They need to take off to be effective!</ARA_HiveCorvette_Building.description>

  <ARA_HiveShip.comps.CompProperties_SendLetterAfterTicks.letterText>A hiss echoed from the heavens as countless swarms of Zerg swept across the colony. A colossal figure cast a shadow that blotted out the sun—the Hive Mothership, the largest nodal entity in the Arachne Swarm, and the pillar of the Swarm's eternal expedition. Now, such a terrifying creature lurks above the colony. It will use every means to destroy your defenses and unleash an endless swarm of Zerg to overwhelm your colonists until it leaves orbit above the colony. Prepare for the impact!</ARA_HiveShip.comps.CompProperties_SendLetterAfterTicks.letterText>
