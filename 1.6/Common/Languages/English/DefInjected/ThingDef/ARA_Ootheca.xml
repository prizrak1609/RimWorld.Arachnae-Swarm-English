<ARA_Pawn_Ootheca.description>It is a fragile, highly flammable, slimy, sac-like structure that contains the nutrients and genetic material necessary to raise a single new larva or larva. A large, incubation chamber filled with Arachne nutrient fluid is the best location. In order to begin hatching, an Arachne larval species must enter the interior.</ARA_Pawn_Ootheca.description>

<ARA_Equipment_Ootheca.label>Arachne cocoon</ARA_Equipment_Ootheca.label>
<ARA_Equipment_Ootheca.description>It is a living body structure of Arachne shaped like a treasure tower. It hatches incomplete individuals that have undergone metamorphosis, i.e. armed organs, fabrics, weapons and clothing for the insect swarm. To start hatching, the Arachne larva species must enter inside. The ideal installation location is a large incubation chamber filled with Arachne nutrient solution.</ARA_Equipment_Ootheca.description>

<ARA_InteractiveEggSac_Techprint.description>It is an egg whose interior grows almost randomly, and cannot be hatched by any insects.It is mainly used for experiments in the direction of mutation.\n\nArachne's technology, which requires a blueprint, can only be completed with this genetic experiment egg.Multiple eggs can work together to research the same technology, and when completed, the genetic information of the technology will be stored in the egg, and if all the genetic experiment eggs with the same technology are destroyed, that technology will be lost!</ARA_InteractiveEggSac_Techprint.description>
