<ARA_Building_SpiderOne.description>This is a special biological structure of the Arachne insects. Although they have the main organs of living organisms, they lack intelligence, and by merging with the nervous system of the insects, they become equipped like a powered armor. The symbiotic muscles provide the host with additional heavy weapons, and the body surface is equipped with numerous micro-armed organs, allowing the Arachne insects to handle forces comparable to human tanks.</ARA_Building_SpiderOne.description>
